# 3DYGeneration

Private geenration of 3DiffDY EFT samples.

Mll binned gridpacks are located at (ask giacomo in case)

One wrapper script starts from one gridpack and generate everything up to nAOD v12 (prepid: SMP-RunIISummer20UL17) following this flow 

```
https://cms-pdmv-prod.web.cern.ch/mcm/requests?dataset_name=DYJetsToTauTau_M-50_AtLeastOneEorMuDecay_massWgtFix_TuneCP5_13TeV-powhegMiNNLO-pythia8-photos&page=0&shown=127
```

The wrapper script can be submitted to condor for generation under a ```slc7``` singularity. 


# Condor

To configure the system make sure you cmsrel all relevant CMSSW releases indicated in the wrapper script e.g.:

```
cmssw-cc7
cmsrel CMSSW_10_6_17_patch1
cd CMSSW_10_6_17_patch1/src
cmsenv
scram b -j 8
cd ../..
tar -xzvf CMSSW_10_6_17_patch1.tgz CMSSW_10_6_17_patch1
```

then you should change the output path of ```submit.jdl``` and can submit via condor.

Beware that failures are expected due to Premix Neutrino guns often appear to be on TAPE. Crab submission should be preferred.


# Crab

Two config files are available for crab submission: 2017 and 2018. To launch crab generation simply run 

```
cmssw-cc7
cmsrel CMSSW_10_6_19_patch3
cd CMSSW_10_6_19_patch3/src; cmsenv; cd -
crab submit crab_sub_2018.py
```

Or equivalently ```crab submit crab_sub_2017.py```
